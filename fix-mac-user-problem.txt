RE-CREATE OLD PROBLEMATIC MAC USER
1. Open System Preference > Users & Groups
2. Delete the problematic user, but select "Don't change home folder", a.k.a do not delete user directory.
3. The deleted user's direcory name will become "<user> (deleted)". Rename this folder name by removing the "(deleted)" part
